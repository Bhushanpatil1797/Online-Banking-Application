🏦 Online Banking Application (Python – Tkinter & SQLite)

Online Banking Application is a desktop-based banking system developed using Python (Tkinter) for the graphical user interface and SQLite3 for secure local data storage. The application simulates real-world banking operations such as account creation, authentication, balance enquiry, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history management.

The system allows users to open new bank accounts with different account types (Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit) and generates unique account numbers automatically. Secure login functionality ensures that only authorized users can access their accounts. All financial transactions are stored persistently in the database and updated in real time.

A Passbook feature is implemented to display detailed transaction history using a tabular view, with an option to download the passbook as a professionally formatted PDF using the ReportLab library. The application includes validations for insufficient balance, negative transactions, and incorrect credentials, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of Python GUI development, database integration, transaction handling, and file generation, making it a complete end-to-end desktop banking solution.
